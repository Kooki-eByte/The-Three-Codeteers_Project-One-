The Three Codeteers project one

## How it works

- When you are brought to the page you will have the search bar to look for a city of your choice.
- When you press enter it will give you the weather and the 5 day forecast of that weather.

  - This gives you the Date, Icon displaying thew wetaher, temp in Fahr. , wind speed, humidity, and the uv index.
  - 5 day forecast only gives date, icon, temp, and humidity

- On the top left there is a Option to pick other choices to search also which gives you the top suggested Hotels in that area, and restaurants.

- There are buttons to give you the about us page
- A button to take you to a page to contact us. (Although still working on that functionality)
